Although he claims to be a gentleman, and talks in the dialect of one, Brook's etiquette has severely degenerated over the course of his isolation. He has awful table manners: he shouts for food while waiting to be served, asks to swap plates with people who have larger servings than he does and eating so messily his entire face is stained. He is also extremely flatulent after meals, but says \"excuse me\" so as to be \"gentlemanly.\" He also loves to tell odd, bone-themed jokes, as well as melodramatic tales, and is very perverted, asking to see Nami and Robin's underwear upon meeting them. \n\nHe's a skilled musician (something Luffy has always wanted in his crew since the beginning), fond of playing the violin. Due to his light weight he can not only jump to incredible heights but can run on water by moving his legs furiously. He uses a shikomizue as his main weapon; with it, he is able to make swift iaidō attacks that the enemy cannot notice."

He first appeared in the Water 7 arc. Franky is one of \"Tom's Workers\", with the original name \"Cutty Flam.\"\n\nFranky's dream is to build a ship that would travel to the end of the Grand Line. This is the ship that the Straw Hats are currently riding, but his dream is not yet achieved until they make it to the end.\n\nFranky usually acts tough and is quickly angered, but he is also very emotional when it comes to sad tales and often bursts into large tears, or on some occasions, plays a song. His most distinguishable personality trait is his flamboyant attitude. He frequently shouts the word 'SUPER' when he's in a positive mood or adds it into his speech. He also has a signature pose which he uses very often.\n\nFranky is quick to defend other people (e.g. Franky Family, Nico Robin) and take action if his friends are harmed. He is also quick in making friends, allies, and comrades with even the most unlikely of individuals. Because of this, he is seen as a 'big brother' figure. Monkey D. Luffy bears similar qualities (with the exception of engaging in unnecessary fights) and because of this, despite the disputes the two had in the past, both grew to respect each other during the events of the Enies Lobby Arc."

At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in a childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.\n\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young male hero/adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D.\"\n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism, and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he is intimidated at the mere mention of him.\n\nLuffy never kills any of his enemies, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or beating them to a point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.\n\nLuffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks."

Possibly one of the best (or even the best) navigators currently sailing the Grand Line, she has the ability to recognize and analyze even the slightest changes in the weather through sheer intuition, thus saving the ship and the crew from the very unstable Grand Line weather on multiple occasions.\n\nNami has a tattoo on her left shoulder (a homage to her past), where she used to have a shark tattoo for being a member of Arlong's Crew. The new tattoo represents mikan (a fruit commonly know as tangerine) and pinwheels.\n\nShe respects Luffy's qualities as a leader, but often gets angry of his irrational thinking and short attention span, even so she trusts him with her life. Despite the fact that Nami has deceived the crew, Luffy still trusts her enough to allow her to safe-keep his precious straw hat. She is almost always the one who gives orders on the ship (much to the Zoro's resentment) because of Luffy's usual lack of common sense. She often comically beats or hits her other crewmates for their nonsense, which occurs quite often. Robin is actually the only person Nami doesn't try to boss, and she referred to her as the only person who understands her, though in a comical fashion. She is very manipulative as well and can even turn an entire conversation in her favor when necessary, often putting on disguises and tricking the enemy. Acting as the \"mother\" of the crew, Nami doesn't understand or approve of the boys' often macho attitudes and principles. These are the only situations where Nami doesn't get the final word.\n\nNami's two favorite things are money and tangerines. She is greedy and will do anything, aside from abandoning or killing her friends, for money. Due to her past - After having gathered money for 8 years (and even before that often stole things), Nami is naturally accustomed to it, but thinks of her friends as more important. She is very manipulative, and often takes advantage of Sanji for his devotion to her and Usopp to maintain her weapons. Roronoa Zoro tries not to fall for her schemes, but ends up a victim like the rest, usually due to debt and blackmail. Nami also tries to avoid fights, and is one of the less adventurous and brave members of the crew. However, since the invention of her Clima Tact (A weapon that forms weather patterns), she is now seen fighting her own battles instead of becoming the 'easy target,' as she doesn't want to be the one being saved anymore."

She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency)  since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by the eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit's power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result. \n\nRobin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die. To atone for his crime, Robin demands that Luffy allow her to join his crew, to which he complies leaving every other crew member except Sanji in shock. Although feared at first, she is quickly accepted and viewed as a comrade by the crew.\n\nRobin is actually an archaeologist of talent, and despises anyone who thoughtlessly damages any piece of history. The World Government fears her because she can decipher Poneglyphs (stones marked with glyphs from an ancient language), which contain details capable of reviving ancient weapons that have the power to destroy the world. In reality, Robin has stated that she does not care about ancient weapons, and that her dream is to find the True History written on the Rio Poneglyph.\n\nRobin is a mysterious and serious person who appears quiet and reclusive, and the wisest in the Straw Hat's Crew. She was thought by those around her to be cold and mean, but it was proven that she is actually a kind person who always thinks before she acts. She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew. She has a vast knowledge of the seas and the world, and usually keeps her head during surprising situations, allowing her to logically analyze the situation without losing her cool. This trait makes her different from the other Straw Hats, who often comically react melodramatically to unexpected happenings and hold irrational ideas and conclusions. Despite her attempts to keep herself distant, Robin has fallen for her new friends, and has taken the role of the distant den mother."

Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style). This is achieved by using one katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally tied on the arm, on his head.\n\nThough not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood.\n\nZoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but, unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.\n\nZoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined."

He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills. Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef \"Red Leg\" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue.\n\nSanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his \"love-cook\" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname \"ero-cook,\" or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around women, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can't attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a \"strict upbringing.\" To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.\n\nHis goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.\n\nBeing the crew's chef, he looks out for the health of his crewmates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He's also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well. In short, he cares as much for the crew as any Straw Hat should, but unlike Zoro, Sanji shows these feelings more."

He also still has distrust in humankind because of events in his youth, where he was treated as a brutal monster. He will often outright insult a human who compliments him while smiling, dancing, and being obviously pleased. He also shows a certain interest in books, but mostly medicine related ones.\n\nChopper is more or less on a journey to define himself, seeing almost anybody on his crew as a role model.

Because of this, he often gets involved in the crazy antics of Luffy and Usopp, wholeheartedly believing that what they are doing is sensible and fun. Chopper is one of the most innocent Straw Hat Pirates, and is also very naive, resulting in a tendency to believe anything told to him, even the outrageously fictitious and exaggerated lies of Usopp. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper and continues to refer to him as \"the emergency food supply\" to tease him but considers him a friend. Although he is the crew's doctor he wasn't originally hired by Luffy for that purpose. But actually, in Luffy's words, for being \"cool reindeer that can transform.\""

He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who's listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except as his alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything. He sometimes sees a role model in Zoro who never seems afraid but always proud. Usopp lacks a bit of self esteem and is often taken advantage of by Nami to make her weapons or repair and improve them - something he is very adept at, having constructed the ingenious weapon \"Clima Tact.\"\n\nUsopp will also stand up and fight for not only the well-being of people, but also for their ideals - and the ideals of a pirate, which he holds very high. In battle he normally tries to trick his enemy by telling tales or mischievous lies to deceive them. Despite his lack of physical strength compared to other members of the crew, Usopp seems to be just as resilient as his comrades and this ability to bear loads and loads of damage, is one of his best traits, in addition to his cunning and intelligence, which has saved the Straw Hats on many occasions. Also, Usopp has outstanding marksmanship abilities with his slingshot and is on his way to becoming one of the best snipers in the One Piece world, although his goal in life is to become a proud and strong pirate like his father Yasopp of the Red Haired Pirate Crew."

These animal parts include a lion's face, the thick skin of an elephant and the condensed muscles of various bears and gorillas. He has eaten the Suke Suke no mi (Clear Clear fruit), which allows him to turn invisible on demand and to turn objects or persons invisible if he touches them. He uses this ability to conceal a pair of bazookas strapped to his arms, which allows him to fire blasts which seem to to come from nowhere. The blasts are incredibly powerful, capable of mowing down trees and setting fiery explosions.

      "image": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/350919.jpg",
      "about": "Arlong the Saw is a sawshark fishman. He was the pirate captain of the all fishman crew, the Arlong Pirates, a former member of the Sun Pirates, and the older brother of Madam Shyarly. He is known for being the main villain in the Arlong Arc and had the highest bounty in East Blue before being defeated by Monkey D. Luffy. \n\nLike many other One Piece characters, he has his own unique laugh, which is \"Shahahahaha\".\n\nArlong considers humans to be inferior beings and is very cruel to them. He is keen to separate his race from humans, and is constantly stuck by this mentality that his people are superior to humans in every way. He thinks nothing of killing a town full of humans, although he seems to prefer controlling people with money and deals (like Nami and Nezumi.)\n\nHe has an eye for spotting exploitable talent that he can use for his goals and is an excellent planner. He spent eight years using Nami and her maps to plan his takeover of the East Blue. Nevertheless, any promise about money he makes, he keeps. The best example is when his crew urged him to keep Nami even if she brings the 100,000,000 Beli. However, even though Arlong states he can't go back on his word, he has no qualms about exploiting loopholes in his deals to unfairly get his way.\n\nHe is rather easy to anger, going berserk after he was attacked by Usopp and having to be dragged back to his base by his crew to prevent him from destroying the whole town. During his fight with Luffy, the boy's constant fighting back made Arlong mad, to the point where it drove him into a deep anger.Arlong himself had expected Luffy to die quickly, but his anger made him become reckless and destructive, even seriously damaging his own HQ building while attacking Luffy.\n\nHe has been ill-tempered since his younger years. However, he wasn't always entirely brutal. During a battle with the Marines, Arlong told Jinbe to leave the unconscious Marines alone. However, it was later shown that he had grown more arrogant over time to the point that he completely had no sympathy for humans. Tiger's death led to his hatred hitting rock bottom. He also failed to understand Fisher Tiger's reason for letting humans that they attacked live. As a result, when Arlong led his own crew and had committed murder, humans came to view him as a \"monster\". He was loathed for the actions of him and his crew. In the end, he enslaved humans just as the humans once enslaved many fishmen.\n\nThough his opinions and his ideals were extreme, he displayed a high level of brotherhood with his crew and even towards Nami despite her species divide. Arlong looked after his crew members and even though he betrayed Nami, he did so because he didn't want to lose her talent. On top of this, in the final moments of the battle with Luffy, he stated that Nami was his crew member and would be forever, and while he never displayed any regard for her as a friend he was prepared to fight to keep her in the crew. If humans insulted their group, Arlong would react to the insult, and due to the high level of concern amongst his officers they would attempt to keep his temper under control. When weaker members of his crew were hurt, Arlong would seek out revenge on those who had committed the act against those crew members.\n\nIronically, Arlong is a hypocrite, having accused Koala of being raised to look down on fishmen and think of humans as better than everyone else, when Arlong looked down on humans and preached fishmen superiority himself, making him no better than the humans. Surprisingly despite his hatred of humanity according to Hatchan, Arlong would never harm his fellow fishmen no matter the circumstance. He cared for his crew to a level that when Luffy used one of them as a shield, Arlong became extremely angry."

      "about": "A formerly brutal pirate with a former bounty of 296 million beri, he appears to be a much calmer, more reserved member of the Shichibukai who merely moves and does what he needs to. Like Mihawk and Donquixote Doflamingo, he was present at the government summit of Mariejoa following Sir Crocodile's defeat in Alabasta. Comparing his height to Perona's in Chapter 473, he is well over twenty feet tall and is only matched in size by Moria's true body. According to Gecko Moria, Kuma is the only obedient Shichibukai of the World Government.\n\nKuma seems to have the ability to teleport, which enables him to appear in the blink of an eye. Although the nature of Kuma's ability is unknown at this moment, he also shows the ability to make anyone he touches disappear to an unknown place, demonstrated when he makes Perona of the Thriller Bark crew disappear by touching her with his bare hand (she most likely went to the destination she said she wished to be). Also, Kuma asks Gecko Moria where he would like to travel to, further suggesting this ability. According to Perona, Kuma was known for his brutality as a pirate. However, his asking of where to \"teleport\" people reflects his change in personality. During a conformation of him and Gecko Moria, it was shown that the two are approximately equal in height, both being inhumanly tall. He also tends to use target metaphors (eg. \"We now have the same target\" and \"You're right on Target, I am Bartholomew Kuma\").\n\nDue to his apparently reserved disposition and the fact that he is invariably seen with a large bible, Kuma is likely modeled after Bartholomew \"Black Bart\" Roberts, a gentleman pirate known for his religious obstinacy. Currently, Bartholomew has met with fellow member Gecko Moria about the appointment of Marshall D. Teach as a new Shichibukai member as well as to offer his assistance on the defeat of the Straw Hat crew. Though he has not met with them, he does have knowledge regarding Luffy's brother, Portgas D. Ace.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He has light green-colored hair in a wild rocker-like style and no eyebrows. He has a demonic looking face, sharp fangs, and a ring piercing on his nasal septum. There are two lines tattooed under his right eye that curve towards his ear. He has a dark tattoo on his chest of a thick ring with an opening on the top, wings on the sides, and long fangs on the bottom. He wears a dark purple coat with a stripe down each sleeve and a plumed collar and cuffs. On the back of it is a face with its head on fire with two crossing sabers just underneath it. He has a light-colored ring-patterned belt with a chain on the left. He has a weapon tucked in the front of his baggy checkered trousers, and has light ruffled dark boots on his feet.\n\nBartolomeo can be rather vulgar and laid-back at times. He is also very provocative, but also mocks his opponents, usually in a nonchalant manner. Even when attempting to stay cool, however, Bartolomeo can become angered when provoked in return. Bartolomeo also doesn't care what anyone else thinks of him and does not seem to hold a high opinion of people. However, Bartolomeo seems to care for his crew (or at least its reputation).\n\n\n\nBartolomeo ate the Bari Bari no Mi, a Paramecia type Devil Fruit which allows him to be a Barrier Human. He uses his Devil Fruit powers both to protect himself and attack his opponents. The barriers are seemingly indestructible. He can also use his barriers to attack his enemies.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

He also now has a large, X-shaped scar on his left temple.\n\nBeckman appears to be a lot less fun-loving and a lot more relaxed than the other members of the crew are, acting as the level-headed member. He, Lucky Roo, and Yasopp are some of Shanks's most trusted crew members, as they are always seen when the Red Hair Pirates are featured, usually when something crucial happens.\n\nAccording to Oda, Beckman has the highest IQ of all the characters introduced in the East Blue saga. Since he is a first mate to a Yonko, he presumably possesses a great deal of strength. During the Battle of Marineford, Admiral Kizaru chose not to fight him, even though he had just fought the First Commander of Whitebeard's crew and Whitebeard himself. It should be noted that Kizaru did, however, continue his attack on Luffy when Beckman came down to join the rest of the crew.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

He is defeated by Sanji but is considered a friend by the Straw Hat Pirates, even aiding them in their escape from Alabasta.\n\nMr. 2 Bon Clay is the only Officer Agent in Baroque Works without a female partner. This stems from the belief that, as an okama, he fills both roles by himself. Likewise, his name is a composite of a male Baroque Works agent's number and a female agent's holiday-based name. \"Bon Clay\" is celebrated in Japan on either July 15 or August 15 because of the use of a lunar calendar. It is a Buddhist celebration found on the last day of the Bon festival, honoring the dead. Lanterns are lit, and the Bon-Odori is traditionally danced.)\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Again, it wasn't really so, but that friendship had some repercussions later on.\n\nBlueno ate the Doa Doa no Mi (Door Door Fruit) which allows him to create doors on any surface. He has even created \"air doors\", doors in the air itself, which lead to what seems to be another dimension. Blueno is also able to create doors on people, and did so to Luffy's face, causing it to spin like a revolving door.\n\nBlueno's tekkai seems to be the one of the more powerful ones of the group, and he was the first to reveal any variations of the move.\n\n(Source: arlongpark.net)"

      "about": "Admiral Kizaru is one of the three Admirals in the Marines. His name means \"Yellow Monkey\" in Japanese while his original name was Borsalino. He was first mentioned by Robin during the initial encounter with Aokiji.\n\nKizaru is a middle aged man with a moderate amount of wrinkles on his face. He has appeared in a yellow striped suit with the standard Marines' coat over it. He wears shades and a portable Den Den Mushi on his wrist. He is very tall, about the same height as Aokiji.\n\nThe way Kizaru's character design is drawn resembles the famous Japanese actor, Kunie Tanaka. \n\nKizaru's personality appears a combination of the more laid-back Aokiji and the more ruthless Akainu. \n\nLike Aokiji, Kizaru seems to be very laid-back and easygoing, even in surprising and unexpected situations, but he's apparently never shocked. Even when a pirate fired a gunshot at him, he seemed to be focused only on calling his subordinate, and didn't even mind. He even asked the offenders where his subordinate was. After uprooting a mangrove tree, he laughed to himself that the force he used was a tad excessive. He's also very calm and cool-headed, even in tense situations, such as when Basil Hawkins appeared unharmed by his attack, or when Rayleigh appeared. Unfortunately, he can be quite absent-minded and irresponsible, judged by the fact he used a lot of power in a kick directed at escaping pirates, uprooted an entire mangrove tree, and tried to call Sentoumaru with a black Den Den Mushi, which is only for intercepting communications. He also seems to prefer his original name, Borsalino, rather than his alias, as shown when Sentoumaru called him and he said, \"This is Borsalino\". \n\nHowever, more in line with Akainu, he is shown to have a ruthless side: he gives criminals, in particular pirates, very little mercy once he has targeted them. He even planned to capture Silvers Rayleigh, who had given up pirating over twenty years earlier, simply because he was the first mate of the Jolly Roger Pirates. Following the events of the Sabaody Archipelago, Kizaru has captured 500 pirates out of spite. Also like Smoker and Sengoku, he sees the Shichibukai as nothing more than just pirates, even if they are on the World Government's side.\n\nAs an Admiral, Kizaru commands vast numbers of Marine troops that are under his rank. Most of all, he has the ability to order a Buster Call attack on any island.\n\nKizaru possesses the power of the Pika Pika no Mi, meaning glimmer or light, a Logia-type Devil Fruit. As a Logia-user, he is able to let objects pass through him and reconstruct his body from energy particles. He's as fast as light. All of his attacks are based on the element of light, such as firing energy blasts from his finger tips or feet. His power is very destructive, causing huge explosions and easily destroying buildings.\n\nKizaru has shown considerable skill with a sword as he is able to duel Silvers Rayleigh to a draw despite his loss of intangibility.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wiki)"

He has since become a highly recurring character in the series.\n\nHe accidentally consumed the Bara Bara no Mi, (Chop Chop fruit) a Devil Fruit, which allows him to separate his body parts and control them independent of each other, but robbed him of the ability to swim. The abilities gained from this fruit also make Buggy immune to attacks from knives or swords; any such attack just separates him into his component parts.\n\nIn addition, most of his body is capable of flying through the air, fast enough to propel a man through a wall—with the crucial exception of his feet. However, even though the parts are separate, Buggy can still feel what the part feels (for example, when Luffy attacked Buggy, he separated his torso from his waist, only to find that Luffy was aiming for the crotch. Needless to say this left him with a rather painful result. Also when Buggy launched his hand out to pin down Zoro for Cabaji's Sting of the Unicycle Technique, Luffy stomped on it, inflicting tremendous pain). He also seems to require either a fixed distance from his detachments, or keep them within his line of vision, in order to manipulate them separately.\n\nBesides his Devil fruit abilities, he usually fights with three knives between his fingers. During the flashbacks of his youth, he already used these three knives. He also has a blade hidden in his shoe, and in Logue Town, he used a sword in his failed attempt to execute Luffy.\n\nMarineford Arc:\n\nLevely Arc:\n\nWano Arc:"

He fights with Roronoa Zoro no sooner than after being introduced and plays dirty by kicking Zoro's wounds whenever he has the chance. But once Cabaji is knocked off his unicycle, he is easily defeated by Zoro's 'Oni Giri' which cuts open his chest.\n\nAfter Buggy's crew was defeated by Luffy, he fought with the 'other' first mate Mohji for the title for the next captain--both were knocked out by a sleepwalking Richie, who gained the title (though lost it just as quick). However, he returned to his former position when Buggy resurfaced.\n\nDuring the Loguetown attack, Cabaji accompanied Buggy and Alvida to fight against the Straw Hats and Navy. However, despite wanting to have a rematch with Zoro, he didn't get a chance to do so.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Wiper is a direct descendant of his.\n\nCalgara was quick to react and a strong believer in traditions of his people. He was hugely mistrusting of strangers. Calgara's personality changed after he met Norland with many of his outtakes of the world changing alongside it. One particular note was that after seeing his God for what it truly was (a giant snake), he dismisses all Gods including the Skypieans \"God\"."

Because of Crocodile's actions and lack of compassion, Chaka was angered to the point that he attacked Crocodile out of rage, but his reasons were also backed by an attempt to protect Vivi and Kohza, as well as buy them time to put an end to the battle - but despite his efforts, he was easily defeated. He survived, however, and showed up later on in the Arabasta arc commanding the royal guard to stop fighting, and later appeared at Pell's grave.\n\nHis latest appearance was during the time when the Straw Hat crew recieved their bounties shortly after the CP9 arc, somewhat shocked to see Robin in the Straw Hat crew.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

He was able to jump back and dodge one of his mother's punches, though he was otherwise powerless to stop her rampage.\n\nMoscato carried a long sword with a handle shaped like an ice cream cone on his back.\n\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

She takes a liking to the Straw Hat Pirates instantly when the crew meets her outside of Water Seven. Franky called her \"shrimp\". She also tends to notice things that others cannot, such as when she spotted Luffy wedged between two buildings (which is where he landed after Rob Lucci knocked him out of Galley-La Corporation Headquarters) or how she managed to find secret passageways in the Tower of Justice at Enies Lobby. She, along with Gonbe, later sneak aboard the prototype Sea Train, Rocketman, and accompany the Straw Hats, Franky Family, and Galley-La foremen to Enies Lobby. And later helped Luffy find the secret passageway that Spandam, Lucci and Robin took on the way to the Gate of Justice.\n\nAs Kokoro is revealed to be a mermaid, it is possible that Chimney, being her granddaughter, may have latent mermaid abilities of her own. Although Chimney doesn't seem to have any mermaid characteristics, she was able to save Luffy, who is 3 times her size, from drowning off screen while resisting what must have been an overwhelming current from the several whirlpools in the sea in front of the Gate of Justice.\n\nCurrently, she is in Water Seven. In the Volume 45 SBS, Oda revealed that Chimney is indeed 1/4 mermaid, and is thus an abnormally good swimmer.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Caesar is also a rather economizing person, as he didn't want to waste the poison, by clearing it off but rather collected, saved and compressed it into Smiley. It was stated by Smoker that he was one \"crazy bastard\".\n\nHe is a very prideful person, going as far to say that his work four years ago on the mass murdering weapon that caused the Punk Hazard incident was not a failure, but instead was a great success, hinting at a superiority complex. Unlike most Logia users, Caesar keeps his Devil Fruit power activated all the time and is either completely or partly turned into gas.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has a distinct laugh of \"Shurororororo\"."

They were not fulfilled and obeyed, and she reports them as trespassers. After this while leading Luffy, Sanji, and Ussop to Upper Yard, Conis under the burden of her betrayal breaks down and tells them the truth. This disloyalty to the god Enel is met with a wave of lightning from the heavens directed toward Conis. Luffy tries to save her but is caught in the middle of it too. Both barely escape with help from Gan Fall ‘knight of the sky. Conis later makes up for her actions, by guiding the Merry Go through Upper Yard, warning her people of Enel's attack, and helping the Straw Hats back down to earth after they had defeated Enel.\n\nConis is head strong, hopeful, and cares deeply for the well being of others. When first introduced she seems happy, friendly, and acts innocent. After meeting the Straw Hat Pirates she keeps all those things. As she becomes more and more courageous, she speaks her mind and is not being afraid of her people's \"God\" Enel as they struggle to fight him. She is very good at playing the harp as well as being able to use a Waver. Though she never fought, she carried a Burn Bazooka and knew how to use an array of dials.

The top part of his head from his nose up, along with his arms and legs, are that of a dalmatian: a white dog with black spots all over the body. He also has a long tail. However, the bottom half of his face is human, and has a blond-white beard on a wide chin. His torso and neck also seem to remain human. He has yet to be seen in his default human or full dalmatian forms.\n\nLike all other Vice Admirals and other high ranking officers, he wears a double breasted suit, dress shirt and tie, with a Marine jacket draped loosely over his shoulders like a cape. His suit, in particular, is dark green. He wore a light red shirt underneath, with a darker red tie. \n\nDalmatian has eaten a Zoan-class Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a dalmatian. Using this, he can increase his fighting prowess and physical strength greatly, and, combined with his Rokushiki style, favors his status as a martial artist greatly. His transformation into a human-dalmatian hybrid seems to differ from other Zoan users, as parts of his body (the bottom half of his face, his neck and torso) remain human while the rest become the animal, whereas the other users' bodies take on complete animal characteristics in their hybrid form.\n\nFirst Appearance: Chapter 553; Episode 462\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

      "about": "Dalton used to be a guard who served under King Wapol, but was opposed to Wapol's treatment of his subjects. He was seen with Wapol in Alabasta in a meeting with Princess Nefertari Vivi's father. He was inspired to rebel by Hiruluk. After seeing Hirluk's noble sacrifice, he turned against Wapol, but was subdued and thrown in prison, constantly mocked by Wapol and his henchmen, Chess and Kuromarimo. After Wapol abandoned his kingdom when Blackbeard invaded, Dalton took charge and kept the island from falling into disarray, soon gaining the trust of the people.\n\nWhen Monkey D. Luffy and his crew came to Drum Island in search of a doctor to cure Nami of her illness during the mission to get Princess Nefertari Vivi to Alabasta Kingdom, they encountered Dalton and some men who thought they were here to rob the island. When asked about a doctor, the only one who could heal Nami was a witch named Dr. Kureha.\n\nEven after Wapol returned and once again subdued him, the people and even the top 20 doctors continued to help out Dalton. He was later seriously wounded by Wapol because he defended the townsfolk from arrows lauched by one of Wapol's bodyguards. And he in turn then, even almost going to extreme measures such as planning to blow up Wapol's castle. Luckily, Luffy defeated Wapol and knocked him off the island, after which the people of Drum elected Dalton as their new king and renamed the island, Sakura Kingdom (inspiried from the special chemical created by Hilruk, which turned the snow pink).\n\nHe appears later in chapter 440, where he shows Doctor Kureha the new bounties of the Straw Hat Pirates. He doesn't live in the castle, preferring to live in the village.\n\nHe has eaten the Devil Fruit known as the Ushi Ushi no Mi, Model: Bison (ウシウシの実 モデル野牛(バイソン) Cow Cow Fruit, Model Bison) which gives him the ability to transform into a bison and into a half human/half bison form that resembles a minotaur. In the English anime the fruit is called the \"Ox Ox Fruit\" and the animal he turns to is an Ox.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He also appears to fear nothing and no one, as he openly taunts Fleet Admiral Sengoku, sits on the table during the Shichibukai meeting and shows only gleeful interest at the thought of warring with Whitebeard. During the Battle of Marineford, all of Doflamingo's interactions have all been for the sake of personal amusement, hinting a sadistic side. He also has an odd habit of sitting in odd positions, like on the back of chairs, on tables, barrels and, even a pile of bodies in the middle of a war zone.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Because of his status and power, defeating him is Roronoa Zoro's ultimate goal. Mihawk is so strong, in fact, he is accused by some characters (and fans) of having the power of a Devil Fruit; however, nothing has stated anything but that his abilities simply come from pure skill and power.\n\nHe wields the Black Sword Yoru, the strongest sword in the world. It's an ornately decorated, man-sized (6 feet) sword shaped like a cross with a shiny black blade, curved at the end. It also seems to generate otherworldly purple streaks as it slices, as seen when he cut down Zoro and when he split Don Krieg's ship in half. He can tear pirate ships apart with a single, unseen slash of his sword, blocking bullets with a simple turn of his sword, and he can easily defend against even legendary swords with a small, inch-long knife concealed in the cross he wears around his neck.\n\nIn appearance, Mihawk wears very decorative, ornate, black-and-red clothing. His most identifiable clothing would be his wide-rimmed hat adorned with a large piece of fluff, a long, black cloak, and his cross necklace and sword. He is easily compared to the real-life pirate Bartholomew Roberts, AKA Black Bart, who also donned a crimson overcoat, a wide brimmed hat with a red feather, and a diamond cross attached to a gold chain around his neck. Mihawk travels around in a coffin-shaped raft with two green-flamed candles, a single black sail, and a single seat. The fact that he can traverse across the unforgiving oceans, as well as the Grand Line itself, in such a meager craft is yet another testament to his abilities.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He has a muscular torso but has skinny arms and legs. Besides his head and shoulders which are covered in armor, he wears an open leather jacket, black pants, cowboy boots, and a long fur cape.\n\nUnderneath his iron mask, Duval surprisingly looks exactly like Sanji's badly drawn wanted poster. Except for his eyebrow which swirls downward instead of upward like Sanji's, he is an exact duplicate to the drawing. Because of this appearance, he had a lot of trouble with the marines and bounty hunters, and thus had to conceal his face in order to protect himself. While Duval received alot of injuries because of this, his most devastating one is a scar on his back which he states is very painful.\n\nUpon confronting Sanji in order to get revenge, Duval got his entire facial structure rearranged by Sanji's kicks. The result of such a crude and violent operation was a complete successful makeover. Due to Sanji's kicks, Duval's entire face had been rearranged into a handsome one completely different from the one he originally had. He absolutely loves it for the benefits it gives. Though turned handsome, Duval however has a hard time winking and thus his eyes would often not wink in unison."

He is always surrounded by nurses and is hooked up to intravenous tubes. But despite this, he still drinks rum by (and directly from) the barrel. Even with his health issues, he is still considered the world's strongest pirate, which raises the question of how powerful he must have been in his prime.\n\nWhen he first appears, he receives a letter from Red-Haired Shanks on behalf of Shanks' newest crewmate Rockstar. However, before even reading the letter, Whitebeard throws it away, claiming that if Shanks wants to talk, then he should visit in person. He even asks Rockstar to tell Shanks to prepare an expensive bottle of sake when Shanks comes to visit. When Shanks finally breaks through a blockade for their meeting, he calls him \"boy\", showing his feelings for the much younger captain, compared to his own age and prestige in the \"New World\" section of the Grand Line.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He believes that he is a divine and immortal being, with the authority to do, take or destroy whatever he pleases. As the result, he appears fearless, childish, and without a care in the world. His lifestyle is relaxed and hedonistic, and when not attending to his godly duties of smiting the natives of Skypeia, he spends his time sleeping or eating (Enel's favourite fruit is apples) in his residence, being waited on hand and foot by beautiful women. This attitude carries over to his battles, where he's hardly serious and barely annoyed - instead he's relaxed, and enjoys himself by effortlessly absorbing attacks, and humiliating his opponents. In his fight against Kamakiri, he even went to sleep in the middle of the fight, in order to prove his immortality.\n\nEnel holds no regard for other's lives except his own, and has no moral qualms about killing thousands- instead he sees it as his godly duty, and laughs as he sends Skypeia to its doom. He is in short completely insane, which was more or less undeniable when he sets off for the moon, which he believes to be the home of God (himself). Before Luffy showed up, his fruit power and mantra ability made his God complex completely legitimate. Once Luffy began gaining the upper hand in the battle he incapacitated him, in order to remove him as a threat, and reclaim his status as \"invincible\" - and from this point acts somewhat cowardly, trying his best to avoid another confrontation with Luffy.\n\nEnel appears to posses a vast knowledge of mechanics and technology, as well. He personally designed his flying ark, Maxim, and knows its inner workings inside and out; if any damage is done to the inside, he is able to repair it (assuming it's repairable). He was even able to design a stormcloud production system (known as Deathpiea), an electrical power system, and a Jet Dial failsafe for the ark, in the event that the main engines are damaged."

He is one of The Eleven Supernovas who are all renowned pirates on Sabaody Archipelago whose individual bounties are greater than  100,000,000 when the Straw Hats arrive in the place. He owns second highest revealed bounty that is still active, surpassed by Luffy's bounty of 400,000,000, and the fourth highest number seen so far in the series, after Donquixote Doflamingo, Gekko Moriah and Monkey D. Luffy. The reason his bounty is so high, is because his crew has caused huge numbers of civilian casualties in the course of their activities. \n\nEustass has pale skin, no eyebrows, dark colored lips, and black-painted nails. He has a flame-like red crimson hairstyle and a pair of square-framed goggles that extends with a \"nose\" that covers the ridge of Kid's actual nose. He wears pants with a yellow and black spotted pattern and, what appears to be a pair of sea boots. His appearance seems to be influenced on Heavy Metal musicians. \n\nAround his waist he has a rather large bright blue scarf and belt where he keeps several knives, and what appears to be a gun. He also has gold bracelets around both wrists. \n\nHe wears a furred captain's coat that is adorned with spikes on it's sides. He typically wears this coat with his right arm in it's sleeve and his left arm under the coat itself. \n\nHe also resembles Luffy when it comes with his relationship to his fellow crewmates, as seen when Killer( his first-mate) always talks to him in a casual manner unlike most pirates. \n\nEustass Kid is notorious for causing a huge amount of civilian casualties. He is generally either angry or making sarcastic jokes. When he feels that he's been insulted, he is quick to resort to violence, attacking Scratchmen Apoo apparently for staring at him (in the anime, Apoo also flipped his finger at Kid's direction). \n\nDespite his violent nature, he knows how to restrain himself when in a tight situation. He is also not blind to the way the World Nobles act, remarking that compared to them pirates are almost humane in nature and that they at least have good sides. \n\nKid has the same dream as Luffy, to find One Piece and become the new Pirate King. Because of this, and Luffy's recklessness, he seems to have a great deal of respect for him. However, while they often encounter the same problems, Kid deals with them in his own way, apparently killing everyone who ever laughed at his ambition. He also seems to believe that possessing the determination to achieve the impossible is necessary to survive in the New World. \n\nDuring the timeskip his bounty became 470,000,000."

Several years ago before the current storyline, he climbed up the cliffs of the Red Line with his bare hands to Mariejois, and attacked the holy land to free the Fishmen slaves there from the Tenryuubito. While he hated humans, Tiger did not discriminate when it came to slaves and thus also freed slaves of all races there as well. Among these other slaves were Boa Hancock and her two sisters. \n\nWith the Fishmen slaves he freed, Tiger changed the shameful hoof mark branded on them signifying slavery, into a symbol of sun and took them in. With them, he created the Sunny Pirates. \n\nAt some point in time however, Fisher Tiger somehow died and his command of the Sunny Pirates was given to Jinbei. \n\nFirst Appearance: Chapter 621. \n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

      "about": "Foxy the Silver Fox is the captain of the Foxy Pirates.\n\nFoxy is a stout man with skinny arms and legs. He has almost a cleft lip-like mouth and an unique hairstyle. His nose is also colored red, it is long just like the nose of Kaku and Usopp. With these characteristics, they make him look like a fox. Foxy typically wears yellow orange suspenders and a coat. His coat is colored purple in the anime, while it is colored silver in the manga and other manga related media.\n\nFoxy is a cheater and trickster, who participates in the Davy Back Fight, a contest between pirate crews where the winning team can steal crew members from the losing team. Most members of Foxy's crew joined him because he won them in this contest. However, they seem to be genuinely enthusiastic about being in the Foxy pirates, and wholeheartedly cheer on their crewmates and captain in the Davy Back Fight.\n\nThough he acts supremely confident most of the time and seems quite fond of himself, Foxy is extremely sensitive to insults or criticism. Any offensive words from others cause him to instantly become depressed, and he usually ends up losing his footing and falling to the ground, barely supporting himself with his arms, while a black cloud suddenly appears over his head. Luckily for Foxy, all it takes is a few kind words from anybody to perk him up again. In the anime, Nami and Usopp used this weakness to their advantage by alternately hurling insults and compliments at Foxy non-stop, leaving him emotionally (as well as physically) paralyzed and unable to help his team during the roller race.\n\nFoxy is a cunning character who uses his Devil Fruit powers as well as various other tricks to aid in him cheating. He also seems to have an extraordinary sense of time, even when he had slowed down multiple cannonballs he still knew exactly when each and everyone of them was going to regain fullspeed.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

It's been speculated that his Tekkai is particularly good, as well, since he took the attacks of the rest of CP9 with relative ease, but this has yet to be explained (if it ever will be).\n\nFukurou claims he is a master of the soru technique, and is the first CP9 member to have used any variations of the move. With his soru he can move so fast that he is unable to be seen. He says that in this way he is like an owl, unseen and unheard by its prey until it is too late.\n\n(Source: arlongpark.net)"

He has to protect his treasures somehow, so he would use his gun and his spooky voice to drive away intruders. Monkey D. Luffy and the whole crew passes the trial and they begin to become friends. However, when Luffy finally gets to the top of the cliff, Gaimon realized that the treasure chests were empty too and he had been protecting a nonexistent \"treasure\" for 20 years. He was offered to join the crew of the Strawhats but he declined. Then, he considers the animals as his treasures, and vows to protect them.\n\nChibi Buggy eventually meets, and befriends, Gaimon in the \"Special Cover Miniseries.\""

Moria apparently has the power to turn people's shadows (including his own) into solid objects due to the power of the Kage Kage no Mi (Shadow Shadow Fruit), but the full extent of his powers are yet unknown. He is the one who stole Brook's, and various other beings' shadows. The loss of a being's shadow causes them to go into a two day coma, and to be vaporized if they come in contact with sunlight. The shadow acts a second soul, duplicating its owner's movements and mannerisms. Moria creates zombies by inserting a shadow into a lifeless corpse. Coupled with physiologically enhanced bodies engineered by Hogback, he is able to create powerful and obedient zombie warriors. However, if the original owner of the shadow dies, the zombie created from that person's shadow will also die. As a result, Moria has the de-shadowed people placed on their ship and removed from Thriller Bark.\n\nHe is an extremely large man and has a devil-like appearance, mainly due to his horns and shadowy figure. His size is equivalent to fellow Shichibukai member Bartholomew Kuma, but he creates smaller (but still impressively large) shadow clones to do his work. He wields a pair of gigantic scissors that he uses to cut the shadows of his victims from their bodies upon seizing them. He is a very calm person and is not even bothered by the fact that his ship and crew are being destroyed. He also has X like marks above his nose and below his chin that may be stitches. Moria's motto is to rely on others to reach his goals. His favorite phrase is: \"You do it!\", reflecting his slothful personality and tendency to leave all work for his underlings. This also expands to his fighting style, as he prefers to lay back and let his own shadow, Doppelman, who he can switch places with at any time, battle with the powers of the Kage Kage no Mi.\n\nTrivia\n\n    * Like many other characters in One Piece, Moria has a strange laugh (kishishishi).\n    * His name is a double-pun on his animal theme gecko and the Japanese word for 'Moonlight' (月光, 'Gekkou'), given his nightmare theme.\n    * Like Luffy and a few other characters in One Piece (including fellow shichibukai Blackbeard and Crocodile), Gecko Moria wants to be the new Pirate King.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He also kept the town together after Arlong took over the island, making sure everyone was safe and able to pay their tax.\n\nGenzo wears a pinwheel on his hat because he used it to make Nami laugh when she was a baby (this pinwheel also inspired an attack for Luffy during their fight with Arlong). He played a role in rescuing Luffy after Arlong threw him into the ocean. All of Genzo's scars are from his first encounter with Arlong when he tried to stop him from taking Nami, Arlong made Kuroobi cut every part of his body with a sword. He was also almost killed by Arlong for hoarding novelty swords, until Usopp saved him.\n\nGenzo's pinwheel inspired Nami's new tattoo--a pinwheel to represent him with a tangerine to represent Bellemere. After Nami sails off with Luffy and crew, Genzo says he no longer needs his pinwheel, placing it by Bellemere's grave. The origin of the pinwheel is then revealed. Bell-Mere said that Nami cried when she saw Genzo because he looked scary, but then Genzo put his pinwheel on to make Nami laugh. It is revealed later in the manga that Luffy is very interested in the pinwheel {this inspires a new attack for Luffy, Gomu Gomu No Pinwheel}, not even noticing the Navy who are trying to find Nami, just Genzo's pinwheel. However, this could be a put down in reference to Luffy's simple-mindedness. He threatens Luffy that if he finds out that he made Nami cry, he'll come after him. However, Luffy lived up to that promise, as Nami's sister, Nojiko pointed out.\nGenzo appears again later, and is outraged by Nami's wanted poster, wherein she is in a bikini, saying she'll get more suitors than bounty hunters, yet has blown it up poster-sized hanging in his house.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Outside of battle, he is extremely helpful and friendly (though it should be noted that he can be just as cruel to humans as the other crew members are), addressing Zoro politely when they first met, and giving him a ride of a bay on his back. Later in the manga (in a title page arc that was never animated), Hatchan goes on many adventures, meeting a mermaid, that ends with him opening a floating takoyaki restaurant. \n\nIn Hatchan's Sea-Floor Stroll, it's revealed that Hatchan, along with Chu and Kuroobi, planned to open a takoyaki store when they were younger. His nickname Hachi could also mean eight in Japanese, a reference to him being an octopus fish-man. \n\nHatchan's name is quite strange. In the Japanese language, chan is a diminutive suffix, added to the end of someone's name, giving it the meaning of \"cute\" or \"little\". However, Hatchan insists that his name is Hatchan and that Hachi is just a nickname. When questioned on this, Oda replied that the chan is the same as the last name of \"Chan\" common in Chinese, rather than the suffix -chan. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He possesses a long brown beard, with three distinctly kept braids, as well as a mustache. He wears a large coat, over an open shirt, that seems to only reach to his shoulders. He leaves his chest bare, with something that appears to be a large wrestling belt with his jolly roger on it. His hair appears to come out of the top of his tricorne, and is braided back.\n\nAfter Whitebeard's death he went off and took control of Foodvalten, one of the New World islands formerly under his protection.\n\nHowever, not too long after making his claim, Brownbeard ended up encountering the Hawkins Pirates. Basil Hawkins casually angered Brownbeard by asking what his name was. Brownbeard then started ranting proudly about his \"over 80 million\" bounty and glory. Hawkins proceeded to say that Brownbeard's name sounds ridiculous and then, as Hawkins drew his sword and prepared to fight, he states that \"he sees the shadow of death upon him\".\n\nHe lost his legs after he and his crew were defeated by Basil Hawkins. After the defeat, he and his crew came to Punk Hazard and they were given aritifical legs by Caesar Clown. His legs would then be replaced by aligator legs with Trafalgar Law's Devil Fruit ability, making him an aligator centaur and allowing him to walk again.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

At first Chopper tried to knock him away, but Hiluluk earned his trust by showing that he didn't have any weapons or intention of hurting Chopper. From then on, the two slowly formed a sort of father/son relationship, traveling (and in a way terrorizing) the island trying to cure patients and generally resulting in them having to literally run for their lives from angry patients or their associates.\n\n\n\n\n(Source: One Piece Encyclopedia)"

      "about": "The president of the Galley-La company, Iceburg is currently 38 years old. He is loved by the people of Water 7, especially by all of his workers. They enjoy his company and often ask for his opinion and input on anything having to do with building ships.\n\nIceburg at times seems to have two different personalities. Sometimes, he acts in a very childish way, canceling all of his meetings so that he can show people around, refusing to meet with people because he doesn't like them, finding animals on the ground and taking care of them, and other such behaviors. He currently has a mouse that he named \"Tyrannosaurus\". However, when the time comes, he can be very serious, and it becomes clear that his childishness is only when he is relaxed.\n\nIceburg was the holder of the plans to Pluton for four years after Tom's death. After those four years, he secretly gave them to Franky, Tom's other apprentice that Iceburg had known since the two were children. However, as this was done in secret, the government still believes that Iceburg is in possession of the plans. As such, some officials come to try and get them from him on a regular basis.\n\nIceburg also believed that Nico Robin deserved death because she was the only person alive who could decipher the ancient Poneglyphs that could revive Pluton. He tries to kill her during the Water 7 arc, but later believes that he was wrong about her and that she is a good person.\n\nThe recent Aqua Laguna and its devastating impact on Water 7 gave Iceburg the desire to make Water 7 into a boat and float it on the water. When talking to Franky, Iceburg gave out Tom's famous quote, \"With a DON!\". Franky agreed that the phrase suited Iceburg.\n\n    * Iceburg was recently voted the 19th most popular character in One Piece.\n    * According to a Volume 43 SBS, Iceburg's birthday is January 3rd. This is because ai is the pronunciation of the English letter \"i\", which looks like the number one. Su is the first part of the Japanese pronunciation of the word \"three\" (surī). Put together, these make Aisu (Ice), the first part of Iceburg's name.\n    * Despite the fact that Eiichiro Oda has spelled his name as \"Iceburg\" multiple times, this isn't always used. Many fans prefer the name \"Iceberg\". The anime itself spelled the name as \"Icebarg\" once, while Oda himself wrote it as \"Iceberg\" in a recent fan poll.\n    * Occasionally, he says “nmaa” before his sentences. It seems he uses it as an ancillary word to express his frustration; similar to the word “well”.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

As a result, Sanji's shadow wasn't given a strong zombie body and as a counterpart wasn't included in the Zombie General ranks, his combat abilities though were praised by other zombies to be on par. He uses Sanji's Fighting Style \n\nUpon seeing Nami in danger, he deliberately stopped the other Zombie Animals from harming her. He stated that even if it would disobey his master, he will not allow a woman to be harmed. His strength in defending Nami from the other Zombie Animals was apparently so great that they started to compare him with the Zombie Generals. The newcomer, despite his efforts, was however defeated by Absalom. \n\nLater, he becomes more obedient. He was able to hold down Robin and Chopper, while he was being helped by Jigorou. \n\nEven though no ego was left, he still couldn't get along with Jigorou, who has Zoro's shadow. They got in a fight over orders. Hogback unintentionally ordered both to jump out of the building, which both did. \n\nAfter having jumped off the building, Sanji's shadow was later taken out of Inuppe and absorbed by Moria along with the other shadows he implanted in his zombie minions.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wiki)"

      "about": "Fujitora was dispatched by Fleet Admiral Sakazuki to deal with Luffy and Law.\n\nHe was first seen in a restaurant in Acacia, gambling with some of Doflamingo's men that were cheating. Luffy called the thugs bluff and helped Fujitora. After giving his thanks to Luffy, he unsheathes a sword from his cane. As the thugs are crushed and collapse into a hole in the ground, he says that being unable to see the world's filth could be considered an advantage of being blind. Everyone stands in awe after his display of power, the crew realizes that he must definitely have some Devil Fruit ability and Luffy immediately asks outright who exactly he is. Fujitora laughs and states that for both their sakes it would be unwise to reveal who he is. As he walked off, he gave the bartender a piece of paper and told him to forward all the damage claims to the address on it.\n\nHe was later seen as a spectator in the Corrida Colosseum. He was apparently scouting out all the big names at the Colosseum, and said to his subordinates that they should leave. He requested 3 battleships and a large number of medical officers and said that he'll go to Green Bit first. Then, he asked his subordinate about the number of spectators, the population of the town, and of the country. When his subordinate asks why that is needed he replies that before counting the number of enemies they should count the number of people needing protection.\n\nWhen exacting retribution on Doflamingo's thugs that were cheating him because of his blindness, he used an unknown Devil Fruit. It has an ability to manipulate unseen force around a chosen location at his will. Firstly, he used this power to create an unseen force of such intensity that it caused the cheaters to be pressed heavily against the floor, which caved in to create a gigantic hole as a result. Later, he used immense amounts of this unseen force to accomplish other feats, such as causing a meteor to fall from the sky. He also uses this unseen force reversely to create a circular barrier around him which repels attacks. As a testament of his power, he stated the act he perform was merely testing his strength.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

Jyabura is extremely competitive, and gets outraged when someone surpasses him (for instance, he didn't like when learned that Kaku became stronger than him). He is also very superstitious, believing that if someone who has eaten a Devil Fruit gets too close to another Devil Fruit, their body will explode as the two devils confront each other, though Blueno explains that this is not the case. While fighting, he tends to deceive his opponents to get them off guard.\n\nInitially Jyabura chooses to fight with Sogeking, but after Sogeking showed to have no match, Sanji abruptly appears and saves his friend from being killed by Jyabura. It then starts a fight between Sanji and Jyabura, where Jyabura is defeated by Sanji's Diable Jambe, which breaks through Jyabura'sTekkai. Jyabura is the only one of his unit to master Tekkai Kempo, a technique that allows him to use martial arts while using Tekkai."

While he was loyal to the Marines he questioned his orders at least twice, showing he followed 'Moral Justice' over their code of 'Absolute Justice'. Saul is also characterized as having a unique, but awkward laugh (\"Dereshishishishi\") that he finds somewhat embarrassing. He enjoys seeing others laughing and having fun and encouraged Robin to laugh.\n\nHe was one of the three people who influenced Nico Robin, Saul wears a cowboy hat which Robin would wear herself. He encouraged Robin to laugh even if it hurts which explains why she smiles at the time of trouble. Because of his middle name, this explains how Robin knows about the Will of D, she even told Luffy later why would he fight, the will of D.\n\nSaul and Vice Admiral Kuzan (later known as Admiral Aokiji) also had a good friendship, and they both shared the same sight on Moral Justice. The reason Kuzan allowed Robin to live was mostly a final favor to Saul."

He proves this by attacking humans within his reach. He, like Arlong, believes that fishmen are the supreme race, showing his arrogance by attacking Gyro's crew with his hands cuffed, showing them that they could easily be destroyed even with the handicap. He then deliberately released the crew, injured but alive, setting them as examples, telling them to spread the word of the New Fishman Pirates.\n\nDespite the fact that they both looked down on humans, his treatment of humans is even more brutal than Arlong's. He considers his human captives to be expendable and sees them as nothing more than pawns, while Arlong had left humans alone so long as they paid him the \"tribute\" money periodically. Arlong mainly killed humans to make examples of them when they did not pay up and was content with leaving them be, aside from odd acts to make sure the humans knew who was boss, but Hody will use them as part of his plan that will almost ensure their deaths, and threatening to kill them outright if they refuse, giving them very little chance to live altogether. \n\nFirst Appearance: Chapter 608\n\n(source: One Piece Wikia)"

During the Marineford war, Jozu was powerful enough to fight on par against the Shichibukai and the Marine Admirals. \n\nJozu has outstanding brute strength, comparable to that of the Giant Squad Marines. He picked up and hurled an immense iceberg at a great distance at the giants protecting Marineford. The iceberg was so enormous that it appeared to be at least ten times as big as any of the giants. Thus, Jozu has demonstrated one of the greatest strength feats seen in the series. And, despite his massive body, his speed and reflexes are on par with his brute force; when he attacked Crocodile after the latter attempted to take Whitebeard's life, Crocodile commented on both the great speed and strength of the attack. \n\nJozu has eaten a currently unnamed Devil Fruit that allows him to transform, parts and most likely all of his body, into diamond. This power has earned him the nickname  \"Diamond Jozu\". It is currently unknown if this is a Paramecia, like Supa Supa no Mi.\n\nJozu's powers give him the ability to greatly increase his offensive and defensive powers. His already strong physical attacks are enhanced by the density of his diamond body. His defenses seem to enhance exponentially, and he is able to block the strongest slash in the world from the world's greatest swordsman, Shichibukai Juracule Mihawk, with no visible damage to himself. However, when his whole body is not in full diamond form, he is still vulnerable to Aokiji's freezing abilities. Other than that, Jozu is weak against the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.\n\nSource:"

(Klahadore was found three years earlier by her father, practically dead on their doorstep. Kaya's father took pity and offered the man a job.) Secretly, the town liar--Usopp--climbs a tree outside her window and tells her tall tales that make her laugh and feel better. However, Klahadore is very disapproving of this and eventually kicks Usopp out and makes Kaya believe that he is a bad influence.\n\nOne day, Usopp listens in on a conversation between Klahadore and Jango, a hypnotist. Klahadore is really Captain Kuro and reveals that he plans to kill Kaya for her money--the last three years he has been gaining the trust of Kaya and the Village. Usopp tries to warn Kaya about the plot, but Kaya believes that he is lying; she rebukes him when he insists that he is telling the truth. She eventually learns the truth, and after Kuro is defeated, she gives the Straw Hats the Going Merry.\n\nShe was recently seen in manga chapter 440, discovering Usopp's Sogeking bounty poster. She and the former Usopp Pirates knew it was Usopp, just by looking at his nose. Kaya comments that she needs to continue to learn more about medicine as she says that when the day comes that Usopp returns he will probably be hurt from all his adventures and she wants to help him. However, his \"pirate crew\" vow to beat him up if Usopp ever makes Kaya cry.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He is also greatly honorable, such as bowing before Sanji (in Nami's body) for saving his torso and thanking him for helping him stating he was indebted to him.\n\nHe is a very old fashioned samurai warrior who expects women to walk three steps behind men and talk gracefully and quietly. He on many occasions referred to Nami as a shameless, violent and obscene woman due to her careless behavior. He felt disgraced when he got hit from Nami on his head. It is not yet confirmed if this is the traditional code of Wano Country or if it is his personal expectations of women.\n\nHe has a tendency to be quite perverted in spite of his old fashioned ideals. Though he seemed to be outraged at Nami's sense of fashion, he still greatly enjoyed ogling at her cleavage. He also has an extremely rude special ability of talking with his farts.\n\nHe cares deeply for his Momonosuke, who was pretending to be his son, as he traveled to the dangerous Punk Hazard island and challenged one of the Shichibukai to find him. Even after being chopped to pieces, his torso and leg still attempted to look for his 'son', and attacked anything that got in the way.\n\nHe seems to be unaware of Devil Fruits, as he said he ate a strange fruit, instead of stating the correct name. \n\nFirst Appearance: Chapter 656\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

After training with Garp, Koby became somewhat thinner and taller. He now stands nearly as tall as Luffy. He also gained a scar across his forehead above his right eye. He now wears a jacket with the standard Marine colors. \n\nPersonality\n\nKoby is first introduced as a cowardly Chore Boy on board Alvida's ship. Through fear of being smashed by her Iron Mace, whenever she asked him who was the loveliest on the sea, he would reply, 'You are, Miss Alvida'. Eventually with the help of Luffy he found the courage to pursue his dream of leaving her and becoming a Marine.\n\nThe first time he appears to have changed is when he and Luffy arrive at the base Captain Morgan is at. Helmeppo holds a gun to his head, but he pulls together his courage and tells Luffy not to worry about him. After their mini-arc series, Helmeppo and he become good friends.\n\nKoby values his friendship with Luffy a lot, as shown when even after their brief fight, he asks if they're still friends.\n\nAbilities and Powers\n\nIn his first appearance he lacked any fighting skills. According to Alvida, the only reason why she kept him on was because he happened to be good at Navigation. He is seen during his mini-arc training alongside Helemeppo and Vice-Admiral Monkey D. Garp. He has since become strong enough to use Rokushiki, or at the very least, Soru. He also has some knowledge of swordsmanship, as he was seen practicing with Helmepppo, as well as Garp's attendant."

After overhearing what her father said about girls not being good at kendo one night, she rushed to find Zoro and challenged him to a duel, with real swords. Though she defeated Zoro again (she was the best in the dojo, he was second-best), she still felt like everyone was looking down on her just because she was a girl. So she and Zoro make a promise that they would continue to build their skills until they were the best swordsmen in the world, after which they would fight each other again for the title of strongest.

      "about": "Kumadori (クマドリ, Kumadori) is one of the last members of CP9 to be revealed, and is recognizable by his large frame, huge mane of pinkish hair, and a right eye that never seems to be open. He seems to honor the samurai honor code very heavily as he comically attempts to take his own life after dishonoring himself. As he accepts the blame for nearly anything, even faults of others, this happens quite often in his appearances. Before he commits seppuku, however, he instinctively uses tekkai every time, unintentionally saving his own life.\n\nHe seems to have strong feelings for his deceased mother, beginning to sob, even while fighting, at the very thought of her. He claims her \"divine protection\" is the reason for his failed suicide-attempts. These dramatic statements are somewhat undercut by Oda's revelation that his mother is in fact alive, and working as an assassin. [3] He claims to dislike lies, though he seems to have no trouble with melodramatic stories. Kumadori is a sennin (仙人, a type of hermit in Japanese mythology who can control even their body's autonomic functions, as well as live forever, similar to fellow Shonen Jump character Jiraiya of the popular series Naruto), which explains his sudden weight gain/loss as well as the ability to control his hair.\n\nKumadori is a very loud character, and utters very few sentences not written in bolded fonts and ending with exclamation marks. He has the strange habit of yelling something resembling \"YOYOI!!\" rather often. He tends to repeat or draw out syllables and words in the manner of kabuki actors. Kumadori's name most likely comes from the Japanese word kumadori (隈取り, a type of makeup used for kabuki), as his features look very similar to those of kabuki actors in their makeup. His body positions (especially his penchant for holding one hand out in front of him) are also reminiscent of mie poses, and his vocal inflection is similar to that of kabuki actors. His fighting abilities seem to revolve around controlling his hair, using it to grab his enemies and attacking them. He also has a shakujō that he occasionally uses in battle. He also has a penchant for spouting off haiku when fighting.\n\nKumadori was originally fighting with Nami, who was at a severe disadvantage. However, Chopper appeared and helped Nami (after Nami had already stolen Kumadori's key) to escape, becoming Kumadori's opponent. Despite Kumadori's advantage of being a sennin, Chopper consumed a third Rumble Ball, and his subsequent \"Monster Point\" form severely injured Kumadori and threw him all the way back to the courthouse."

His skill is such that at full speed he is only able to be seen as a vague blur or by the damage his attacks cause. He primarily uses a special attack called Shakushi (Death Scoop/Death Ladle), that allows him to sweep a large area, killing anything his claws connect with at random, including his own crew. The technique travels roughly the same speed as CP9's Soru ability. The difference is that when Kuro uses that technique, he cannot see what he is attacking, whereas CP9 have mastered this ability and therefore can.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

      "about": "Kuzan, better known by his former alias Aokiji, was one of the three Marine admirals. He was nominated by Sengoku for the position of fleet admiral. However, after losing the position to Akainu, he resigned from the Marines. \n\nKuzan is a very laid back man, showing no shock or surprise from almost anything. His lack of interest and lazy justice (as he describes his motto himself) let others often believe he can not possibly be a marine of such a high ranking. However, if he deems a situation worthy, he will take action, as shown when he created a passage to another island for a few injured castaways at Long Ring Long Land.\n\nHe seems to be the kindest of the three admirals, helping Tonjit at Long Ring Land to cross the ocean with the power of his Devil Fruit and even letting Nico Robin escape the Buster Call on Ohara. He seems to dislike the Shichibukai, or at least Crocodile; he said that the only reason he did not kill Luffy was that Luffy had defeated Crocodile. \n\nIn contrast to his fellow admiral Sakazuki, Kuzan has a sense of honour, as he keeps his word to not attack the Straw Hats after accepting a one-on-one fight with Luffy. Kuzan's moral stance is unknown, but it is likely that he follows Moral Justice. He is disgusted by Sakazuki's brutal actions in dealing with situations (such as the Ohara Incident), calling him a fool. While he may follow Moral Justice, he does understand the position his ranking puts him in, as he does not hesitate to do what is necessary for the needs of the Marines, as shown when he freezes Jaguar D. Saul after the Ohara incident, and attacked Luffy and Whitebeard during the Marineford War.\n\nAokiji was a faithful follower of the World Government. He always tried to obey orders but sometimes found his own ideals in opposition to his orders. Even as he followed his orders, he would sometimes exhibit a sense of mercy and honor that other World Government officials did not. Like many characters in One Piece (for example, Jaguar D. Saul and Smoker), after witnessing the senseless murder of many innocent people, Aokiji may have come to realise how low these events have sunk the World Government.\n\nHis relaxed demeanour while performing the more macabre of his duties is similar to that of Borsalino, making him one of the more complicated characters in the series. Despite not really wanting the position of fleet admiral, he was even more opposed to Sakazuki getting the position, and fought his fellow admiral rather than letting him take it. After being defeated, Kuzan chose to resign from the Marines rather than stay under Akainu's command."

      "about": "Laboon is an extremely large whale (of comparable or greater size than the monsters in Calm Belt), native to West Blue, whom the Straw Hat Pirates encounter immediately after entering Grand Line. Fifty years earlier, Laboon had been left at the bottom of Reverse Mountain by a group of pirates who had befriended him. Since his species travels in pods, he had forged a powerful bond of friendship with these pirates, and he patiently waited for them at Grand Line's entrance. His caretaker is a doctor named Crocus, who normally mans the Lighthouse that introduces travelers into Grand Line. \n\nCrocus revealed to the Straw Hat Pirates that Laboon's friends effectively abandoned him by fleeing the Grand Line through the Calm Belt. (although this may not be true as Brook described his crew as being slaughtered in the Florian Triangle) The pirates were recently revealed to be the crew of Brook the skeleton, leaving him as Laboon's only crewmate left. The old doctor has cared for Laboon ever since his friends left him. Although Laboon knows the truth about his friends, he refuses to admit to himself that they are gone. Laboon has many scars on his head from slamming into Reverse Mountain, for he believes he can destroy the mountain and return to West Blue. \n\nMonkey D. Luffy, in an effort to give Laboon a renewed sense of hope, picks a fight with the whale by jamming the Going Merry's mast into his head. After the battle (which Luffy calls a draw), Luffy promises to Laboon that he will return to see him, under the guise of wanting a rematch. As a sign of this, Luffy paints the Strawhat Jolly Roger on Laboon's head, commenting that the insignia will wash away if Laboon hits Reverse Mountain further. The Straw hats depart, leaving behind two important friends. \n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nNo voice actors have been added to this character.

In addition, he is also one of the top four commanders of the Whitebeard Pirates, making him one of the top four fighters on board under Whitebeard himself.\n\nHe is capable of retaining consciousness despite the powerful Haki of Shanks, a Yonkou. He has incredible reflexes, as he is able to instantly respond to Kizaru's light-speed movement and attacks to protect Whitebeard. He was also able to touch Kizaru, who is normally intangible due to his Logia ability. This may indicate that Marco is capable of using Haki.\nMarco possesses super-human strength, as shown when he kicked Kizaru down to the ground at extreme speed, however it is unclear if it's natural or comes from the fact that he is a zoan-user.\n\nMarco ate a Devil Fruit referred to as a Mythical Zoan that turns him into a Phoenix. This first and foremost gives Marco increased speed and flight, as well as the possibility of launching aerial attacks. Along with being able to transform into a blue phoenix, the fruit allows him to regenerate any wounds with fire. It is a power that is said to be even rarer than Logia. The fruit gave him his nickname: Marco the Phoenix. Marco has more control over his Devil Fruit than any other Zoan-user to date; it's so great that he can change just some limbs while the rest of the body remains human.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

Shanks also warned Whitebeard that Blackbeard was becoming stronger than him and had only joined his crew to stay hidden behind the massive shadow of the Whitebeard name, until he became strong enough to make his move. This time came when Blackbeard murdered a member of the Whitebeard Pirates, thus prompting his departure from the crew, and Ace's hunt for him. Blackbeard was also the one who gave Shanks the scars around his eye, a long time ago. Shanks also tells Whitebeard to call back Ace on his hunt for Blackbeard, as he was concerned about the timing of a confrontation between Ace and Blackbeard.\n\nAfter Luffy defeated Crocodile in Alabasta, Lafitte tried to nominate Blackbeard to become one of the Shichibukai to take Crocodile's place, but in order to be accepted, Blackbeard must first build up a fearsome reputation.\n\nBlackbeard happened to be in Jaya, at the same time Luffy was. Both Luffy and Blackbeard seem to strike up a rivalry when they nearly got into a fight over how they like or dislike one of the island tavern's food. However, not long after that he'd given Luffy a friendly speech about how pirates will never stop dreaming. Despite their similarities (and comical contrasts), it was revealed in the Jaya arc that Blackbeard was looking to take out a strong pirate to make a name for himself - and he chose Luffy after learning of his 100 million Belli bounty at the time. He however failed to catch them as they were blasted aside by the knock-up stream which took the Straw Hats to Skypiea. \n\n\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

      "about": "Mohji is the first mate of Buggy's Crew. Quite pompous and at times silly, Mohji has the ability to control any animal he wishes, or so he says. He has yet to prove it in the series outside of his pet, a lion named Richie, who is more like another crew member than just a pet. Mohji usually opts to use him in battle rather than fight himself. He is, however, fast and agile, and very skilled with a whip. He is also responsible for burning things, such as the pet-food shop and the Going Merry.\n\nIn his first appearance, Mohji was sent by Buggy to capture Roronoa Zoro. However, Monkey D. Luffy got in his way, who eventually defeated Mohji after he burned down a pet-food shop that belonged to a recently deceased man and his still-living dog.\n\nAfter Buggy's defeat Mohji and Cabaji fought over leadership of the group. They were equally matched, and fought for several hours. The battle ended when a sleep-walking Richie knocked them both unconscious, taking over leadership himself. However, Richie and the pirates were kidnapped by a cannibalistic group, but saved by Buggy, Alvida, Mohji, and Cabaji.\n\nMohji later participated in the attack on Loguetown. It was his job to burn down the Straw-Hat's boat, which he failed to do as soon as it started to rain. Nami and Usopp found him and Richie, but as soon as Mohji sent Richie to attack, Usopp used an egg to distract the lion. The Marines showed up, and started shooting at everyone. Mohji was able to dodge the bullets and flee the scene with the rest of Buggy's group.\n\nMuch later, Mohji reappeared with the group as they travel in the Grand Line and find a mysterious man named Portgas D. Ace. He was also in the TV Special that featured the One Piece characters as ninjas, and appeared in several video games. Every time Mohji appears in the series for an arc, his hairstyle changes. During the Buggy arc, his hair was shaped like a teddy bear; the Loguetown arc had him wearing a pink helmet with bunny ears sticking out; and when the group makes it into the Grand Line, his hair is shaped like a lion's mane.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Later, during the battle at Arlong Park, he called upon by Hatchan (his caregiver) to the fight the Straw Hats.

Momoo is possibly an ophitauros.\nIt can make a \"mooo\"ing sound like any cow.

Garp is considered by Whitebeard as one of the few people that know the seas from the time of Gold Roger.\n\nEarly on in Luffy's life, he was trained by Garp to become a strong Marine. Luffy was thrown into valleys, left alone in dangerous forests, and tied to balloons over high altitudes, all for the sake of making him stronger. After this he left Luffy and Ace in the care of Dadan. \n\nGarp is first introduced in Koby's mini-series as the Marine Officer in charge of escorting Captain Morgan. However after falling asleep, Morgan makes his escape by striking Garp and taking Helmeppo as a hostage, fleeing on a small dingy. Garp then wakes up unharmed, apparently breaking a cannon in the process of waking up.\n\nWhen Koby begs to chase after the two, Garp allows Koby to pursue them. Upon the boys' return they offer themselves to be punished, but Garp instead proposes a different course of action. He states that the pair of them are nothing but trouble and the only way to ensure they still in line is that he takes charge of the pair. He takes them back to Marine HQ where he begins to train them to become great Marine Officers. \n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia, Wikipedia)"

This feauture was passed down to his descendants.\nHe was a well built man who often wore a black coat and orange scarf.\nAfter his execution, Norland's image was distorted over the years due to the shame that was brought to his name.

He was happy-go-lucky and had a strong determination as well as being friendly. His only flaw seemed to have been acting without consulting people on things (such as cutting down the Shandians sacred trees), however he only did what he thought was (and usually is) best for people.\n\nThe Norland who is depicted in the stories is a grinning fool who often went away on long expeditions only to return with stories that seemed unbelievable.

He can also normally be seen smoking a cigar. \n\nThree years ago, Morgan looks much like he does in the present storyline, except without the axe hand and the metal jaw. He was also of a slimmer build than in the present storyline. \n\nPrior to \"capturing\" Kuro, Morgan seemed to be a brave man who was not afraid of death. After his promotion, Morgan was corrupted by his power and became who he is today. \n\nWhen Morgan is first introduced, he is governing over the small island of Shell Town, where his Naval base is located. Yet he is ruling by fear, abusing his rank to make people pay taxes, and even going as far as killing his own men if they do not obey his commands. He has a very spoiled son named Helmeppo, who is just as bad at using his father's rank to get what he wants from the island's inhabitants. Morgan shows no sort of fatherly love for Helmeppo, even stating that Helmeppo was a worthless son not even worth hitting. \n\nMorgan's obsession with rank is proven in his battle against Luffy, where, despite not being able to to land a single blow on the rubberman (and having taken several), he would not accept defeat. \n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

Mozu is the sister with the yellow bikini top, yellow slacks, and straight edged hair, while Kiwi is the sister with the red top, red bikini bottom, and curly edged hair. They have a tendency to mimic his reactions. They often walk sideways in high winds, due to the fact that otherwise their hairstyles would cause them to be blown back. During battles, they fight with samurai swords, but are not especially powerful, as Franky and Kalifa easily subdued them. They both also have a tendency to add \"Waina\" too all their sentences.

      "about": "First Appearance: Chapter 128; Episode 79\n\nMr. 11's real name is unknown. He is a Frontier Agent for Baroque Works in One Piece. His partner, Miss Thursday, is not shown. He makes a very short appearance in two episodes during the Arabasta arc. In the first, he is captured by Captain Smoker in Lunas and tied to a flag post. On Smoker's ship, he unwittingly reveals some information about Baroque Works. In the second, the ship is in Arabasta.\n\nWhen an unforeseen event happens that causes the crew, including Smoker, to leave their ship, Mr. 11 tries to free himself. Surprisingly, \"Billions\" (henchmen for Officer Agents) board the ship. Mr. 11, mistaking them for \"Millions\", (henchmen for Frontier Agents) yells at them to untie him. The \"Billions\" then reveal their rank and are hence the same level as him (agents above ranked of 10 are not much stronger than the Billions). Then Mr. 11 apologizes, but too little too late for they have no intention of freeing him. Then \"Mr. Mellow\" comes toward Mr. 11 and says \"It's about time a post got opened.\" and shoots Mr. 11. Though his death isn't shown, Mr. Mellow's comment makes it a likely possibility, especially as Tashigi tells Smoker he was murdered in the same chapter/episode.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

Musse went willing to the altar to save all her people. Just before their God devoured her, Montblanc Norland appeared and killed the giant snake who tried to convince the Shandians that this plague was curable and not a curse from the gods.\nDuring the time Norland spent trying to find the cure, both her and his men were locked up in cages, she spoke to the men on who their captain was. After a struggle against time, Norland brought the cure back and the Shandians were saved. Musse now free and knowing the truth, was seen later sobbing in her mothers arms over the events that had happened.\nHowever, her tribe found that their forest which they found sacred has been chopped down by Norland and his men, and they were once again ostracized by the tribe. She later explained to one of Norland's crew as to why the Shandians are treating him this way, and after she learned they cleared the forest because it originated the plague in the village, she quickly rushed to tell the villagers, and they rang the golden bell as hard as they could to inform Norland of their regret, and her father Calgara rushed towards Norland before he and his men set sail to ask for his forgiveness. Three years later, she is married to Seto.\n\nSource:"

It is revealed that Vivi is actually the princess of Alabasta, but infiltrated Baroque Works as Miss Wednesday to find the identity of the leader, who turns out to be the Shichibukai member Sir Crocodile. With help from the Straw Hat Crew, she was able to reveal the truth to her people, ending several uprisings and stopping battles that would have forever ruined the nation. \n\nTrivia\n\nThe word \"Nefertari\" in Vivi and her father's names is ancient Egyptian, and means \"the most beautiful\" or \"most wonderful\". It was a word often used to describe Egyptian queens and princesses. Oda admitted the Alabasta arc was based around ancient Egypt, but apparently had no clue on what the word meant when he chose the name. \n\nDespite her long absence from the series and her separation from ties to the Straw Hat crew, Vivi was featured on the cover page of chapters 271, 423 and 484, usually reserved to Straw Hats. That makes her the only non-Straw Hat other than the Going Merry to appear on a cover page. \n\nIn the English manga and anime, her name is romanized as \"Nefeltari Vivi\". \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

However, he compensates for his lack of shigan by carrying guns with him, and compensates for his lack of tekkai by being very careful to avoid taking blows.\n\nNero attempted to stop Franky from rescuing Robin but was punched through the roof of Puffing Tom, into the room where the rest of CP9 was. Nero then continued to try to fight Franky and stated he would kill him, but Lucci wouldn't allow this, as they were simply supposed to be capturing him. Lucci then gave Nero three seconds to escape, at which point Lucci quickly took him out with five shigan attacks. Lucci then personally disbanded him from CP9. It is unknown whether or not Nero is dead or alive, as Lucci is a very skilled, shoot-to-kill sort of person, and Nero's limp body was thrown into the ocean during Aqua Laguna, one of the biggest storms in the world."

An example of a typical routine: \n-Ichika: Luffy is a pirate. \n-Nika: Luffy is a pirate! \n-Sanka: Luffy isn't a pirate. \n-Yonka: Luffy might be a pirate. \n-Yonka Two: So what if Luffy's a pirate? \n\nOther than that, they are cheerful and friendly and they usually stay close together.\n\nFirst Appearance: Chapter 608; Episode 527\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

In his past life he was known as 'the Demon of the Frozen Land', having conquered and mercilessly ruled over many countries and islands over five-hundred years ago. His 'rebirth' as a zombie is an event of great importance to the crew of Thriller Bark. In order to make Oars the strongest zombie ever created, Gecko Moria implants the shadow of Straw Hat Luffy into the zombie's body.\n\nHaving Luffy's shadow in his body, Oars's attacks have names similar to Luffy's moves (Gomu Gomu no Scythe, Gomu Gomu no Volcano). Though he is initially incapable of stretching his body, he gains this ability when Gecko Moira takes control of his body. Despite his immense size, Oars is extremely fast, moving so quick that he almost disappears for an instant before unleashing an attack. Making matters worse, small doses of salt have no effect on him because of his size."

His mortal blow techniques: Bamboo Leaf Panda Drop and Giant Panda Deathlock. His Explanation: Abandoned in a bamboo thicket as an infant, Panda Man was raised by Giant Pandas. (all of these mentioned are not seen in the One Piece manga or Anime, and as such it should be taken with a grain of salt.) He is an Akuma Chōjin who resolved to become strong because when he told people he had seen Kaguya-Hime, they didn't believe him and picked on him. (Kaguyahime was a princess who was found inside a bamboo stump, according to Japanese legends.)\n\nAccording to Oda, Pandaman is a rich guy living on a certain island.[9] He is often seen in the same panel as one of the Tomato Gang, a debt collector on the lookout for Pandaman, trying to collect the money Pandaman owes (which is why Pandaman is often seen running away on appearances).\n\nPandaman's bounty is revealed to be at least more than 3,333,333 beli during the Anime Filler Arc Ice Hunter on Episode 326, as Kanpaccino's hand blocks the entire number.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

(Though in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc he wore a black jacket emblazoned with roses and chains.) His hair is blond and slicked back on his head while wearing a pair of orange goggles on top. He's usually seen frowning.\n\n\nPersonality:\nPaulie is shown as the closest to and most trusted by Iceburg. He also shows a different outlook on the way many female characters in One Piece dress. Unlike most other characters such as Sanji, Paulie often becomes outraged at how much body women such as Nami and Kalifa show off when they are in the company of men.\n\nWhen he is first introduced, he tries to steal two suitcases full of money from Luffy to pay off his gambling debts. Though he is thwarted by Lucci, he still asks for 10% as a service fee.\n\n\nFighting Style:\nPaulie has a unique fighting style; a complicated use of ropes that appear from under his sleeves. The amount of rope he carries is absurd, measuring hundreds, if not thousands of meters as he was actually able to make a huge, complex rope-work in a split-second to keep not only himself, but also the entire Franky Family, their Kingbulls, Oimo, and Kasshii from falling into the huge pit in Enies Lobby. He also boasts that the Galley-la rope he carries never breaks no matter what loads it carries.\n\nWhen he attacks, the ropes generally snake their way out his sleeve and wrap around the target. \n\n\nHistory:\nDuring the opening day of the Puffing Tom, a young Paulie was seen attending it's coronation.[2] Inspired by this event, Paulie decided to become a shipwright. He then grew up and joined the Galley-La Company. He then became one of the company's top foremen.\n\nPaulie first appeared to the Straw Hats as one of the five Galley-La foreman of Dock 1 in Water 7, specialising in the mast and rigging."

Lulu fights with double-weapons, although what weapons he uses change at times; he has been seen fighting with swords, guns, and saws, though he tends to stick with swords later in the story. Lulu constantly has part of his hair sticking up. When he tries to push it down, it always pops up somewhere else, such as the other side of his head, his mustache, and other people's heads. In most situations this is simply humorous, with other characters looking at him funny for it or simply ignoring the oddness. However, at times it actually comes in handy; in battle, Lulu can make the hair come out of somebody's nose to distract them, leaving them open for him to attack. \n\nSource:"

      "about": "One of the most obvious features on Ace is his tattoos. Ace's back tattoo is left intact in the English version of the dub despite 4Kids' previous edits to crosses. At the same time Ace also promotes his tattoo to Luffy, something which is truly considered odd by 4Kids standards. Ace has a tattoo on his back of the Whitebeard symbol; a skull with a white mustache and a manji behind it. To avoid confusion between the two symbols and avoid slander for being a nazi, this was changed to crossbones in the shape of a \"cross\" in the anime, as well as in the most recent chapter of the manga.\n\nAce has another tattoo on his left arm by the shoulder: it reads \"ASCE\" with the \"S\" (apparently a mistake on the part of the tattoo artist, or, alternatively, the symbol that appeared on the flag of his old crew  crossed out. In the English version of the anime, Ace's shoulder tattoo signifying his name is edited out, as he is referred to there as \"Portgaz D. Trace.\" He appears in One Piece Grand Adventure, once again without the tattoo on his arm.\n\nAce travels around the Grand Line on his boat which is constructed so his Mera Mera no Mi fuels the engine on the rear end allowing it to move.\n\nCurrently, Ace is one of the two known pirates to ever escape arrest by the Marine captain Smoker, the other escapee being Ace's younger brother Luffy. Ace and Smoker fought to a standstill in Alabasta.\n\nHe left Fuusha Village three years before Luffy, and he is a loyal crewman and commands the Second Division of Whitebeard, his captain.\n\nIn appearance, the two brothers are obviously related, despite the fact that Ace is more muscular than the rather lanky Luffy. He also sports rather childish freckles. He is apparently narcoleptic (a trait common amongst Ace's family) and therefore falls asleep on random occasions, making people wonder if he has dropped dead. As far as personality goes, Ace is much more intelligent, polite, and generally more bearable than his younger brother, which prompts the Straw Hat crew to question whether he is truly related to their bumbling captain. However, the brothers themselves are very close, Ace portraying typical good-big-brother behaviors such as asking the crew to keep an eye on his little brother.\n\nIt is revealed that Ace had a bounty of 550,000,000 in the One Piece Ten exhibition.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Helmeppo then ordered the naval marine standing behind him to throw her out and he reluctantly does so, but luckily, Rika was caught by Luffy before anything bad could happen.\n\nThe reason Zoro was imprisoned by the Marines was because he defended Rika when she was nearly attacked by Helmeppo's pet wolf. Because Helmeppo saw this as a crime towards himself, he ordered Zoro to stay imprisoned for thirty days. Zoro, not wanting to cause any more trouble, accepted.\n\nRika later becomes friends with both Helmeppo and Koby during their stay in Shell Town, and becomes upset when the two leave with Vice-Admiral Garp. She later appeared in a filler as well as TV Special 4 and where she is friends with Ninjin, Piman and Tamanegi.\n\nHer only known relative is her mother, the bartender Ririka.\n\nShe is voiced by Kate Oxley in the Funimation dub. Her seiyuu is Emi Uwagawa, and her English voice in the 4Kids dub is done by Lisa Ortiz.\n\nFirst Appearance: Chapter 3; Episode 2\n\nSource:"

It appears to have no special significance. While acting as Lucci's voice Hattori expresses human body language, matching the behavior of a professional shipwright: constantly insulting and lecturing Paulie because of his reckless lifestyle. Hattori seems to have affection for his emotionless and bloodthirsty master, as seen when he flew to Lucci's unconscious body. He also seems to leave his master when he enters any sort of battle, returning directly afterwards. Hattori's name presumably comes from combining the Japanese word for pigeon, hato (鳩) with the word for bird, tori (鳥).\n\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

He has a long, thin, curved moustache; spiral marks on his huge cheeks and he also seems to have no eyebrows, having two dark spots in their place instead. He also wears a rather expensive looking gold necklace with a red gemstone embedded in it.\n\nOn his head, he wears a tall blue marine hat which is also unique in that no similar marine hat was ever seen before or after.\"\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

His logic is that if even one of the scholars of Ohara had escaped with it, the mission would've been a failure, much to the dismay of Aokiji, who called him a fool for overdoing things. As an Admiral, Akainu is able to command vast number of Marine troops that are under his rank. Most of all, he has the ability to order a Buster Call attack on any island. In addition to this, given that he holds the same rank as Kizaru and Aokiji, it can be assumed that he commands comparable fighting abilities to those two.\n\nHe has the devil fruit ability where he is able to transform his body into magma.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

Furthermore, he is Monkey D. Luffy's childhood hero and a former member of Gol D. Roger's Crew. Overall, he is greatly respected by most of the characters, despite having a \"soft\" and friendly nature and never appearing in actual combat until he started a fight with Whitebeard. As a whole, he does not make many appearances in the series, although he appears in a majority of the opening or closing themes of the anime.\n\nShanks always wears a long black cape over his shoulders and until he met Luffy, wore a straw hat that he had worn for many years beforehand. He always wears trousers that are cut below the knee as well as a pair of sandals. The most striking thing about Shanks is the color of his red hair, of which his nick-name \"Red Haired Shanks\" comes from. He also has three scars across his left eye, which were given to him by Blackbeard a long time ago. He has a missing left arm, that he had lost when he saved Luffy from a Sea King. Shanks and his crew are almost always seen partying and drinking alcoholic beverages whenever they make an appearance as the Captain's favorite pastimes are attending and hosting parties and banquets.\n\nAccording to Oda, Shanks is the one character that resembles himself the most out of all the One Piece characters, because of his fun-loving partying nature."

      "about": "Shepherd is a commander from Marine Headquarters that comes to G-8 in order to inspect it. He came to the base onboard the Stan Malay which suffered earlier from a storm upon arrival. He is the closest thing to an actual antagonist in the G-8 Arc as opposes both the Straw Hats and the G-8 Marines. However throughout the entire Arc, he has had all sorts of bad luck from being accused of being a Straw Hat called Condoriano to accidentally helping the Straw Hats numerous times.\n\nShepherd is a grayish skinned man with a ponytail. He normally wears the official Marine over coat and purple clothes. These clothes and a pair of purple eye glasses were stolen by Robin when she assumed his identity. After he was freed from the brig, he regained his clothes but apparently not his eyeglasses. \n\nShepherd thinks himself to be superior over other Marines due to his high rank. He would often threaten others with decommissions, court martial, and such unless his orders as followed or if things don't go his way. Shepherd thinks lowly of G-8 and it's commander, Johnathan. He believes that the base and Johnathan are completely useless due the base's reputation and the Vice Admiral's methods. Shepherd would thus do anything from writing a bad report to showing off the G-8 Marines just to see the base be decommissioned.\n\nShepherd thinks so low of G-8 that he has refused help from Johnathan when the latter offers him some of the base's Marines to aid the inspector in locating the Straw Hats. Due to this stubbornness of his, Shepherd has thus done several actions that don't cooperate with the rest of G-8's attempts to capture the Straw Hats. The majority of these actions have ended unintentionally helping the Straw Hats out of tight jams.\n\nWhile Shepherd thinks himself to be superior, it has been shown that should the situation arise he shows a more cowardly side. This has been shown most prominent in a discussion between him and Johnathan. During the middle of the discussion, Shepherd decided to toy with Johnathan's fishing rod in order to mock the Vice Admiral. The normally calm Johnathan however responded to Shepherd's action in a tone which apparently made the inspector think otherwise.\n\nShepherd's overall personality is somewhat akin to that of Spandam's. \n\nShepherd possesses no special abilities or powers per say, however he does possess a special weapon called the Eagle Launcher. This extremely large bazooka is as he says is the latest and greatest portable bazooka that has been developed by the Marine Headquarters. It is as he says like the talons of a bird of prey hence it's name. It's power is on par with that of a small battleship. However despite the weapon's power, Shepherd isn't exactly an expert on using it. The weapon in fact unintentionally aids the Straw Hats several times than actually destroying them.\n\nUpon arrival in G-8, Shepherd is infuriated by having to weather a storm to get to the base and not having anyone welcome him. He refuses to disclose his rank and division to a lower ranked Marine, stating that he is a special VIP from the Marine Headquarters and needs not to disclose such information to the likes of the later. Shepherd then demands an audience with the commander in charge of the base, Johnathan. However due to the base's motto concerning food, Shepherd is denied it until the Vice Admiral finishes his lunch. Regardless, Shepherd decides to go to the Command Center by himself with plans to relieve Johnathan of his command with his report. However as soon as he walks into a hallway, he is attacked by Nico Robin, who assumes his identity after hiding him.\nShepherd is identified as Condoriano by Usopp\n\nWhen he is later discovered, he is thought to be a member of the Straw Hat Pirates, with Usopp claiming he is really named Condoriano and he had lost his memory.[4] After some ruckus caused by the Straw Hats in the base, which included Robin as being identified as a Straw Hat in disguise, Shepherd's real identity is revealed and he is freed from prison. With all that's happened, Shepherd decides to take matters in his own hands in order to belittle Johnathan and the rest of G-8 when he learns the Straw Hats would come to retrieve their gold that had been confiscated earlier.[6] He does so regardless of the Stan Malay's captain's request to let their troops recover from the wounds they suffered from the storm.\n\nWith his men, Shepherd confronts four of the Straw Hats that had been conered in the G-8 vault. With the intent of paying back the humiliation that was inflicted on him, Shepherd decides to handle the situation himself disregarding a fellow Marine's warning to not underestimate the Straw Hats. He then pulls out an extremely large bazooka, the Eagle Launcher and aims at the Straw Hats. However due to a mistake in holding the weapon in the wrong position, he instead fires it backwards. With a little help from Robin's ability, Shepherd's own weapon is then used on his own men and then later used to propel himself into the air. With Shepherd himself and the other Marines in the room temporarily knocked down by the Eagle Launcher, the four Straw Hats escape from them. With that, Shepherd then decides to execute his next tactic against the Straw Hats. With his forces on the Pine Peak, he orders them to intercept the Going Merry at the G-8 sea gate and sink it before the pirates before they could escape. Unfortunately this plan too goes wrong. The Pine Peak unintentionally showed the Straw Hats where the current was wherein they could steer Merry, which was disguised as a Marine battleship then. Shepherd's plan was then once again thwarted as the rest of Going Merry's disguise collided with the Pine Peak.\n\nBelieving that the Straw Hats were finally going to escape, Shepherd decided to leave the rest to Johnathan's forces. Should the Vice Admiral fail to capture them, Shepherd threatened to hold Johnathan for everything that's happened. However in response, Johnathan simply replied to the Inspector to include in his report himself as being a hindrance in G-8's operations to capture the pirates. Shepherd then witnesses the base's special 9 o'clock low tide trap the Going Merry. Fearing that he will become nothing more than a nuisance in the whole affair, Shepherd snuck away from Johnathan and decides to use the Eagle Launcher on the Straw Hats one last time. However upon trying to aim at Luffy while the ship had become airborne thanks to Usopp's Impact Dial and the Octopus Balloon, Shepherd accidently shot the turret that was aiming at the octopus. His actions unfortunately aids the Straw Hats in escaping. After the incident, Shepherd returns to Johnathan and threatens to decommission the Vice Admiral for allowing the pirates to escape regardless of the fact that Johnathan is Admiral Akainu's protege. He is however met with Jessica, Johnathan's wife, punching him out in the face. As the Straw Hats leave G-8, and Johnathan and his wife laugh off the events that had happened, a knocked out Shepherd simply lies on the ground."

Ryuuma believed that when one gets saved, they must repay their debt else they don't have any values. He believed this was the way of a true swordsman. To this, Ryuuma would sometimes follow the request of someone he owes almost blindly, even when it would otherwise contradict his other philosophies. He also believed that a battle isn't measured by how much fame one gets from it, but by what was protected.\n\nAs a swordsman, Ryuuma had this one particular habit. Whenever someone would touch their sword sheath with his, Ryuuma would immediately take it as a form of challenge for a duel to the death. This is because Ryuuma believed that the sword is a swordsman. For this, Ryuuma would then immediately fight the person whose sheath touched his. This was a particularly bad trait of his, despite his honorable intentions, as this would sometimes get him into trouble.\n\nRyuuma, having heard the reputation of \"The King.\" hoped to one day fight against him. He believed that this King holds a great \"Warrior's Soul\" and would make a worthy adversary. The irony however, is that he is \"The King.\" Because the name, \"King,\" was given by the people he usually saved, he unfortunately didn't know it himself.\n\nRyuuma also had a bad habit in managing money and when he ate food. Because of this, Ryuuma would often unfortunately find himself penniless and hungry for days. \n\nRyuuma reappears in Eiichiro Oda's main series, One Piece as a revived zombie in the Thriller Bark Arc where he embodies the shadow of the recent Straw Hat Pirate Brook.\n\n(Source: One Piece Encyclopedia)"

After Robin appeared she told Soran all about her adventures on Skypiea and this gave Soran the hope of someday drawing pictures of islands all over the world. When Robin was discovered by the guards Soran and her aunts tried to hide her but this only angered the guards and they were prepared to torture Soran and her aunts to find out this information. Luckily Robin handed herself over to the guards thus sparing Soran. Later on Robin and the rest of the slaves are freed by the Revolutionaries. \nFirst Appearance: Episode 420\n\nSource:"

He seemed to share similar principles to Sanji and Zeff as he was shown to be impartial to any customer regardless be they pirates but does not laugh at Luffy, Zoro and Nami. This suggests that he was able to see through the fact that the two Straw Hats were only holding back to prevent a bigger ruckus from occurring. He is the one who serves cherry pie and soda to Blackbeard and Luffy.\nFirst Appearance: Chapter 223; Episode 146\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)"

In the anime, instead of Aokiji, Tonjit's grandson appeared from the ground, riding a mule which gave Tonjit transport.\nTonjit's clothing, nomadic lifestyle, his horse, and his dwelling in a yurt seems to be based on the lifestyles of the nomadic peoples of Central Asia (specifically Mongolia.)\n\nSource:"

He is one of eleven pirates who have been referred to as \"The Eleven Supernovas\" on Sabaody Archipelago whose bounties are higher than  100,000,000 when the Straw Hats arrive in the place. Law is a slim and tall man wearing a black-sleeved yellow shirt with his Jolly Roger on it. He has many tattoos on his arms, as well as a pair of small earrings on both ears. On his left hand in particular are the letters D, E, A, T, and H tattooed on each of his fingers. The word formed from this letters is \"DEATH.\" Law also carries along a nodachi with which he uses with his Devil Fruit powers. It is sword with a scabbard decorated with crosses from the opening to the bottom. Law is an extremely laid-back character, who is nearly always seen smiling (although not with a huge grin, like fellow Supernova Urouge). He also has a more reckless attitude when faced against other pirates that the World Government has labeled as a higher threat: For example, he casually asked X. Drake how many people he had slain in his very first appearance, and had no qualms about flipping his middle finger at Eustass Kid, the most wanted Supernova on the Archipelago (even smiling defiantly when doing so). However, he hates being ordered around. He is also unfailingly polite, usually referring to others as \"Mr\", and appears to be honorable enough to refuse taking credit that is due to others."

Because of his duplicitous conduct and allegiances he can be considered the secondary antagonist of the Punk Hazard Arc. \n\nThrough his short discussion with Trafalgar Law, Vergo proved himself to be a shrewd man due to his mistrust of Caesar Clown, having Monet placed on the island to monitor his actions. He can also come across as somewhat condescending, mocking Law's position by pretending to have some respect for the Shichibukai. Seeing himself as above the Shichibukai, Vergo quickly reminds Law of the difference in their power by beating him unconscious. He's also shown to be a person who demands respect from others, such as when he demanded that Law refer to him as Vergo-san.\n\nVergo stated that his favorite food is hamburgers. He appears to be a very messy eater, as he was first shown to have the hamburger still on the side of his cheek.\n\nWhile around citizens, Vergo is said to be an amiable person, much unlike the other G-5 Marines. The parents of the children kept on Punk Hazard trusted Vergo's words that all of the missing children died in an accident. His statement caused them to partly believe that they were truly gone, though some parents still believe that their children are alive. Easily deceiving both citizens and the entire Marines organization, Vergo has proven himself to be highly manipulative.\n\nDespite his perceived intelligence however, Vergo can at times seems to lapse into moments of air-headedness such as when he claimed to Caesar Clown that he had been enjoying coffee and cookies, only to be reminded shortly after that there had never been any cookies to begin with. \n\nFirst Appearance: Chapter 671, episode 597\n\n(source: One Piece Wikia)"

Luffy in acts such as chomping his two advisers into a single warrior, or shooting bombs from his \"Baku Baku Factory\" pistol arms. He even tries to eat all the weapons inside his massive armory room to turn himself into a superweapon. Though, Nami manages to steal the key from him when Wapol catches her.Luffy also chases him to a room after chessmarimo is defeated where he reveals a large cannon called the \"Bre King Royal Drum Crown VII Cannon\" (\"mega monster seven barrel super shot\" in the dub). Although, when he was about to shoot Luffy, he realized that it was jammed by a snowbird nest. Probably the most shocking thing about Wapol is that he was able to swallow himself, and munch away all his excess body fat, turning him into an extra skinny form when he found himself too big to follow Nami through a small doorway. He brags a lot about being the king of Drum Island. Wapol is blasted far away from Drum Island by Luffy's Gomu Gomu No Bazooka/Gum Gum Bazooka and soon lands in a forest village. He wakes up and eats everything in sight transforming to whatever he eats. He soon starts making toys out of what he eats in which the village children are entertained with. A man sees this and offers Wapol a job. Wapol soon accepts and after making many toys becomes the CEO of a gigantic toy corporation and is now dating miss universe."

He fought against Monkey D. Luffy during the survival game yet their match ended in stalemate. Later, he, along with Nico Robin, Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Enel, and Gan Fall, survive Enel's survival game, but Enel defeats Wiper with his Goro Goro powers when Wiper refuses to join him. Wiper uses Seastone and Reject Dial, a powerful Dial weapon that causes great damage to both the enemy and the user, for the kill. However, Enel simply uses his powers to restart his own heart and strikes the Shandian warrior down once more. Later he uses it for a third time that day-he supposedly should have died after the second use-to help the Straw Hats knock over Giant Jack so Luffy can reach Enel's ship during the climax of the Skypiea Arc. After Enel's defeat, Wiper sees peace finally come between the Shandians and the Skypieans. Wiper fights using a Burn Bazooka and a Reject Dial, though he is skilled at close combat, mainly involving the use of Skate-type Wavers to boost his kicks. Currently, he's helping to rebuild the Shandian's village with the others.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Although he often criticizes Luffy's choice to become a pirate and his growing infamy (He was disappointed that the citizens started drinking to celebrate Luffy's latest bounty), he seems to actually care for his well-being, such as when he pleaded for Higuma to spare Luffy's life when he was a young boy. His criticism of the most infamous member of the village, seems to come more from the fact Woop Slap is an authority figure himself, thus he finds Luffy (and by extension, his father) waging war on the World Government as absurd. He even believed that Luffy is better than the choice of his nakama who became infamous with him, referring to them as \"freaks\". He seems to talk to Makino often about Luffy as she appears to be the only one in the village willing to listen to him. \nHe is familiar with Garp and his family (including Dragon), stating how he thinks all 3 generations of Garp's family are crazy.

He also wears a black cape, which, from the inside, is crimson-colored, with a fur coating around the neck.\n\nLike his fellow Supernova, Basil Hawkins, Drake appears to be a pirate who abhors needless violence especially if he knows it would cause too much attention \n\nThough he carries a four bladed axe as part of his weaponry, he is also known for swordsmanship. The sword he is seen wielding is a rapier-like sword. His skill is enough that he was capable of interrupting the fight of two other Supernovas with just one move. \n\nHe has also achieved physical strength to the degree where he was able to kick aside a \"copy\" of the Shichibukai, Bartholomew Kuma. \n\nAs a former Marine, Drake has a deep understanding of the workings of the World Government, and is able to use this knowledge to protect himself from danger and predict the movements of the Marines.

Ichika starts off first by saying a regular statement. Nika then states an exclamatory version of Ichika's statement. Sanka then states the opposite of the original statement. Yonka then questions the original statement. Lastly, Yonka Two then questions whether the original statement matters or not. An example of a typical routine: \n-Ichika: Luffy is a pirate. \n-Nika: Luffy is a pirate! \n-Sanka: Luffy isn't a pirate. \n-Yonka: Luffy might be a pirate. \n-Yonka Two: So what if Luffy's a pirate? \n\nOther than that, they are cheerful and friendly and they usually stay close together.\n\nFirst Appearance: Chapter 608; Episode 527\n\n(source: One Piece Wikia)"

      "about": "Appearance\nYorki is a yellow haired pirate who typically wears a cowboy hat. He also has two tattoos on his face. One under his right eye and one under his lower lip. The tattoos resemble that Japanese Kanji (ヨ). He also wears a green captain's coat.\nIn the anime, prior to his full appearance, he was depicted as a young brown haired tattoo less pirate that wore a tricone instead of the cowboy hat. His coat was also colored red instead of green. This was later changed in accordance to the manga's depiction.\n\nHistory\nFifty years ago before the current timeline, as Yorki and his crew were sailing the West Blue, they came across a baby whale that was lost. Seeing that the whale was crying, Brook, one of Yorki's crew, suggested that they cheer the whale up with some music. Having cheered the thing up, the whale, Laboon, began following Yorki and the rest of the Rumbar Pirates through their adventures. As Yorki and crew drew nearer to the Grand Line however, Yorki and some of the other Rumbar Pirates asked Brook to convince Laboon to stay in the West Blue since he was the closest to the whale. This was because Yorki and the rest feared that Laboon was too young to face the dangers of the Grand Line. When Brook's attempt to convince Laboon failed, Yorki ordered his crew to ignore Laboon and not play any music in hopes that Laboon would stop following them.\n\nGrand Line\nSeemingly having convinced Laboon to stop following, Yorki and his crew sailed into the Grand Line through the Reverse Mountain. Upon arriving at the Grand Line, Yorki and his crew met up with Crocus and asked if they could stay to repair their ship. To their surprise then, they found out that Laboon had followed them into the Grand Line. For the next three months, Yorki and crew stayed to fix their ship whilst singing with Laboon all the while. Seeing that the Grand Line was just too dangerous for a young whale, Yorki asked Crocus to take care of Laboon while they ventured into the Grand Line. As Yorki and crew left Laboon in Crocus's care, they promised to return someday in two to three years and take Laboon back with them.\nWhile in the Grand Line, Yorki and his crew experienced all the hardships that the sea had to offer. Along the way, Yorki and his crew fought against a Marine base. For this attack, Yorki's bounty went up. Despite the challenges they encountered, Yorki and his crew sailed onwards. \n\nDisease\nHowever, after disembarking at a forest, Yorki and some of the other Rumbar Pirates contracted an incurable disease. In order to save the rest of the crew, Yorki decided to take himself and the other infected, and escape the Grand Line through the Calm Belt. With much regret, Yorki told the crew that were still well to give his regards to Laboon. As he lay dying, he asked Brook to play his favorite song to send him off. Yorki's attempt to escape was then written in a report. However the report misinterpreted Yorki's escape as an act of cowardice rather than show his actual reason.\n\nAnime and Manga Differences\nIn the anime, prior to Yorki being properly shown in the manga, he was depicted as a typical tattoo less pirate wearing a typical tricone. This depiction of him was due to the unclear image of him during Crocus' flashback then in the manga. The image depicted Yorki shaking hands with Crocus however the captain's appearance was obscured along with the rest of the crew, with no indications at the time of the character Brook (who was noted as being thought up at the time of Laboon but not introduced until over three-hundred chapters later). The anime however changed this after he was fully revealed.\n\nTrivia\nYorki's nickname resembles that of the real life pirate, Calico Jack.\n\n(source:  )"
